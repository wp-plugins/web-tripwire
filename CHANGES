0.1.0
 * ADD: An additional administration menu option to view this file. So that
        users can determine if later versions of the plugin fix any issues
        they might be experiencing.

 * ADD: Begun adding support for GnuPG. I'll be using this to verify central
        signature batch updates. This feature is not yet fully functional.

 * ADD: As a quick fix to the JavaScript toolbar theme compatibility issues
        I've provided an option to select from a list of DOM elements for
        where the object should be placed.

 * FIX: Resolved some logic issues in the Notifier module.

0.0.9
 * FIX: Previewing posts and pages was causing multiple stream reading
        failures, which would bloat the httpd log to extreme proportions.
        Now resolved! This one was a show-stopper.
