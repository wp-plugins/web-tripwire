0.1.0
 * ADD: An additional administration menu option to view this file. So that
users can determine if later versions of the plugin fix any issues they might
be expiriencing.
 * ADD: Begun adding support for GnuPG. I'll be using this to verify central
signature batch updates. However, I need to enable support on my own web
server before I can start testing.

0.0.9
 * FIX: Previewing posts and pages was causing multiple stream reading
failures, which would bloat the httpd log to extreme proportions. Now 
resolved! This one was a show-stopper.
